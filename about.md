# Hi.

I have a deep interest in all things computer-security and software exploitation.

This blog is here to document some of the big attacks we see in DeFi, at a lower-level than most other blogs.

I'll be looking at the high-level exploit, and breaking it down at the source or EVM level. I'll be documenting logic errors, architectural vulnerabilities, low-level EVM misuse, and misplaced trust.

I'll also be considering some of the patterns which have been developed to protect smart-contracts from exploitation or manipulation, highlighting their drawbacks, and how they might be misused.
